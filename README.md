# Godot Modular-Quest-System (Demo)

This repository contains a minimal demo project showcasing a modular,
event-driven quest system built in Godot (C#).

## Features
- QuestManager activating steps sequentially
- Modular QuestSteps (Interact, Kill, StayInArea)
- Signal-based decoupling from scene hierarchy
- UI-driven demo triggers for clarity

## Demo Controls
The demo scene uses UI buttons to trigger interactions and events.
This avoids player input complexity and keeps the focus on system logic.

## Notes
- This is a system-focused demo, not a full game
- Visuals are intentionally minimal
